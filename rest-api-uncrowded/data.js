The rugged trail, wet in spots, takes you through thick boreal forest. Halfway to the bridge, the secluded beach at Playter Harbour offers a pleasant spot for a rest, snack and bathroom break. It is also a good place to turn back if you are too weary to continue all the way to the bridge. The White River Suspension Bridge is a highlight for many. The bridge spans 30 metres across the chasm at a height of 23 metres. Take your time and feel the mist from the river and the thundering of waterfalls as you cross over. Please record your name and date in the check-point registration book located just before the bridge. Soon after the bridge, you will encounter a portage trail veering off the coastal trail to the right. Follow it downstream to a modest picnic spot at the base of Chigamiwinigum Falls.

The climb from the valley floor is more than 100 m (300 feet), but you will be rewarded for your efforts by a magnificent view to the north.  As you ascend the Trail above the railway tracks, you will notice some old railway rails that cross the Trail. Here you can take the newly-opened Lime Kiln Side Trail which leads for 600 m to the site of the pinnacle of early 20th century technology: a Hoffman Ring Kiln. The huge stone blocks spring out of the forest like a prehistoric ruin. The kiln was used for burning dolostone to create lime, a vital ingredient for early industrial and agricultural purposes. Retracing your steps to the white blazed main Trail, continue to follow the blazes south, up the Escarpment through a magnificent area of tumbled rock - nature's rock garden - until you reach the base of Devil's Pulpit.  A short climb up the stairway will reward you with magnificent views across the Credit Valley and the satisfaction of having climbed 100 m (300 feet) from the valley floor.
